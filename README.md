FTNL Simple parser
===================
# What it is
This program is a simple parser that outputs beautiful
content from a plain text file written in the FTNL language.

# What is FTNL ?
FTNL stands for : Fast Notes Taking Language. It is a language
that tends to ease the process of organizing information on the fly.
Its syntax is fairly simple, and is designed to be read easily as
a plain text file (like MarkDown), but stands on the main principle of
mindmaps : ideas are disposed hierarchically in a tree.

# Is there any documentation on that thing ?
Not yet ; the language isn't fully specified yet ; it's
really in a brainstorming and experementing phase.

# What is this software for ?
This software is a kind of prototype for a parser, made in order
to outputs plain content into some beautiful content, as HTML,
or Freeplane mm for instance.

For now, only some really basic HTML and Freeplane mm is supported.

# Usage
see ./ftnl.py --help

# Versioning stuff
At this moment, the project is at a kind of draft state. I need to define
a more precise plan before any versioning goal.
